        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Gas</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">1. What is natural gas and how is it formed?</p>
            <p>Natural gas is a fossil fuel primarily composed of methane, formed from the decomposition of organic material over millions of years under heat and pressure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">2. Is natural gas renewable or non-renewable?</p>
            <p>Natural gas is considered a non-renewable resource because it takes millions of years to form and cannot be replenished on a human timescale.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">3. What are the main differences between natural gas, propane, and butane?</p>
            <p>Natural gas is primarily methane and is supplied via pipelines. Propane and butane are byproducts of natural gas processing and petroleum refining, stored as liquids under pressure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">4. How can I detect a gas leak?</p>
            <p>Gas leaks can be identified by a strong sulfur-like odor, a hissing sound near gas appliances, dead plants near gas lines, or an unusually high gas bill.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">5. What should I do if I suspect a gas leak?</p>
            <p>Avoid using electrical switches, do not ignite flames, evacuate immediately, and contact emergency services or your gas provider.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using natural gas?</p>
            <p>Advantages include efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and lower emissions than coal. Disadvantages include methane leakage, environmental concerns, and finite availability.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">7. How does the extraction of natural gas impact the environment?</p>
            <p>Extraction methods such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) can cause groundwater contamination, seismic activity, and habitat destruction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">8. Can natural gas be used as a primary source of electricity?</p>
            <p>Yes, natural gas power plants generate electricity by burning gas to produce steam that drives turbines, making it a widely used energy source.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">9. What safety measures should be taken when using gas appliances?</p>
            <p>Ensure proper ventilation, install carbon monoxide detectors, regularly inspect appliances for leaks, and follow manufacturer guidelines for usage.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">10. How does liquefied natural gas (LNG) differ from compressed natural gas (CNG)?</p>
            <p>LNG is natural gas cooled to a liquid state for easier storage and transport, while CNG is stored under high pressure for use in vehicles and industrial applications.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">11. What role does natural gas play in global energy production?</p>
            <p>Natural gas accounts for a significant portion of global energy consumption, used for electricity generation, industrial processes, and residential heating.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">12. How does natural gas compare to renewable energy sources?</p>
            <p>Natural gas is more reliable but emits greenhouse gases, whereas renewable sources like wind and solar are cleaner but depend on weather conditions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
            <p class="faq-question">13. What are the geopolitical implications of natural gas production?</p>
            <p>Countries with large natural gas reserves influence global markets, and pipeline dependencies can create political tensions between supplier and consumer nations.</p>
